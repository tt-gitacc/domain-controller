The purpose of this guide is to show you how to secure your network and improve its management capabilities by implementing a domain-based network infrastructure (manually and through PowerShell). First, I will show you how to promote a Windows Server to a Domain Controller. Then, I will show you how join a Windows PC to your new domain, and finish by showing you how to build an efficient file-sharing environment by creating and combining a File Share, a Security Group, a GPO and a Mapped Drive.
